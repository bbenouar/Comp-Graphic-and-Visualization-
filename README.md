How do I approach designing software?

	Approach: designing software involves identifying the requirements, understanding the user needs, and defining clear objectives. For OpenGL projects, it starts with conceptualizing the visual elements I want to create, such as 3D models and scenes.
	New Design Skills: Working on an OpenGL project helps me develop skills in spatial thinking, understanding of lighting and textures, and how these elements interact in a 3D space. I learn to design not just for functionality but also for aesthetics and performance.
	Design Process: it starts by imagining the scene, then drawing out the interactions and gradually improving the details to make it look more realistic.
	Future Application: The skills gained can be transferred to designing complex interactive systems in gaming or VR applications.
How do I approach developing programs?

	Approach: Development starts with setting up a basic rendering loop, then expanding by adding complexity such as lighting, textures, and user interaction. The focus is on writing clean, manageable code that adheres to good software engineering principles.
	New Development Strategies: While working on my 3D scene, I focused on performance optimization techniques such as efficient memory management and optimizing rendering pipelines to ensure the scene runs smoothly. These strategies were crucial for handling the complexities of rendering and interactions in OpenGL.
	Role of Iteration: Iteration helps enhance 3D scenes by making small, continuous improvements, like adding details or adjusting lighting and texture, which improve the overall quality and performance.
	Evolution of Code Development: My coding approach advanced from basic setups to incorporating advanced features such as shaders and lighting, demonstrating a deeper grasp of OpenGL and graphics concepts.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

	Educational Pathway: Studying computational graphics provides foundational skills in visual processing, beneficial for careers in game design, simulations, and data visualization. These areas often use visual techniques to interpret complex information effectively.
	Professional Pathway: Expertise in computational graphics can lead to opportunities in software development, graphic design, and VR/AR development. Proficiency in these skills is crucial for creating engaging and efficient visual content in industries like entertainment and technology.
