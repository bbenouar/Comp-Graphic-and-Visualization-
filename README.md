## üöÄ How Do I Approach Designing Software?

- **Approach**:  
  Designing software involves identifying the requirements, understanding user needs, and defining clear objectives. For OpenGL projects, I start by conceptualizing the visual elements I want to create, such as 3D models and scenes.
  
- **New Design Skills**:  
  Working on OpenGL projects helps me develop skills in spatial thinking, understanding lighting and textures, and how these elements interact in a 3D space.

  
- **Design Process**:  
  It starts with imagining the scene, then sketching out the interactions and gradually improving the details to make it look more realistic.
  
- **Future Application**:  
  These skills can be applied to designing complex interactive systems in gaming or VR applications.

## üíª How Do I Approach Developing Programs?

- **Approach**:  
  Development begins with setting up a basic rendering loop, then expanding by adding complexity, such as lighting, textures, and user interaction. The focus is on writing clean, manageable code that adheres to good software engineering principles.
  
- **New Development Strategies**:  
  During development, I focus on performance optimization techniques, such as memory management and optimizing rendering pipelines to ensure smooth operation of the 3D scenes.
  
- **Role of Iteration**:  
  Iteration is crucial to enhancing 3D scenes. Small, continuous improvements, such as adjusting lighting and textures, improve both the visual quality and performance.
  
- **Evolution of Code Development**:  
  My coding approach evolved from basic setups to incorporating advanced features such as shaders and dynamic lighting, demonstrating my deeper understanding of OpenGL and graphics concepts.

## üéØ How Can Computer Science Help Me Reach My Goals?

- **Educational Pathway**:  
  Studying computational graphics provides foundational skills in visual processing, which is beneficial for careers in game design, simulations, and data visualization.

- **Professional Pathway**:  
  Expertise in computational graphics can open opportunities in software development, graphic design, and VR/AR development. These skills are essential for creating engaging and efficient visual content in industries like entertainment and technology.
